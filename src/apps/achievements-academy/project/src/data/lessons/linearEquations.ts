        content: 'A linear equation has an equals sign and contains variables to the first power only. To solve equations, we use inverse operations to isolate the variable.'

        type: 'question',
        content: 'Solve for x: 3x - 8 = 16',
        options: ['x = 6', 'x = 8', 'x = 10', 'x = 12'],
        correctAnswer: 'x = 8',
        explanation: 'Add 8 to both sides: 3x = 24. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 8.'

        content: 'Solve for y: 2y + 5 = 17',
        options: ['y = 5', 'y = 6', 'y = 7', 'y = 11'],
        correctAnswer: 'y = 6',
        explanation: 'Subtract 5 from both sides: 2y = 12. Divide by 2: y = 6.'

        content: 'Solve for z: z/4 = 7',

        correctAnswer: 'z = 28',
        explanation: 'Multiply both sides by 4: z = 7 Ã— 4 = 28.'
