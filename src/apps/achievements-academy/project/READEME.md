    Headings scale appropriately (text-lg sm:text-2xl lg:text-4xl)

3. Adaptive Spacing & Sizisng

    Icons: h-4 w-4 sm:h-6 sm:w-6
    Borders: border-2 sm:border-4

The application now provides an excellent user experience across:

    Desktop (1024px+)

All interactive elements are properly sized for touch interaction on mobile while maintaining the fantasy gaming aesthetic across all screen sizes.

I've fixed the modal scrolling issues and created a comprehensive color theme system:

‚úÖ Fixed Modal Scrolling Issues:

Modal Structure Improvements:
    Flex Layout: Used flex flex-col for proper modal structure
    Fixed Header/Footer: Headers and footers are now flex-shrink-0
    Scrollable Content: Main content areas use flex-1 overflow-y-auto
    Max Height: Set max-h-[90vh] to prevent modals from exceeding viewport

Responsive Scrolling:
    Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
    Touch-friendly scrolling on mobile devices
    Proper scroll indicators and smooth scrolling

üé® Color Theme System:

Created src/styles/themes.ts:

    4 Complete Themes: Fantasy, Ocean, Forest, Sunset
    Comprehensive Color Palettes: 7 color ramps with 10 shades each
    Gradient Combinations: Pre-defined gradients for consistency
    Subject-Specific Themes: Mathematics and English realm customizations

Theme Structure:

interface ColorTheme {
  colors: {
    primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, neutral
  };
  gradients: {
    primary, secondary, accent, background, header, etc.
  };
  subjects: {
    mathematics: { gradient, headerGradient, border, emoji, title },
    english: { gradient, headerGradient, border, emoji, title }
  };
}

Available Themes:
    Fantasy Adventure (Current) - Blue/Purple magical theme
    Ocean Adventure - Cyan/Teal underwater theme
    Forest Quest - Green/Lime nature theme
    Sunset Magic - Pink/Orange warm theme

Easy Theme Switching:
    Simply change export const currentTheme = oceanTheme; in themes.ts
    All components will automatically use the new color scheme
    Utility functions for accessing theme colors and gradients

Benefits:
    Accessibility: All themes maintain proper contrast ratios
    Consistency: Unified color system across all components
    Maintainability: Easy to modify colors in one place
    Extensibility: Simple to add new themes or modify existing ones

The modals now scroll properly on all devices, and you can easily customize the entire app's color scheme by editing the themes file! üé®‚ú®

Create missing user_progress and exam_scores tables
    supabase/migrations/create_user_progress_and_exam_scores.sql

I've created a migration file that will add the missing user_progress and exam_scores tables to your database. This migration includes:

    user_progress table - tracks lesson completion for each user
    exam_scores table - stores exam results and scores
    Proper indexes for efficient querying
    Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data
    Foreign key constraints linking to the users table
    Triggers to automatically update the updated_at timestamp

The tables are designed to match the TypeScript definitions in your src/lib/supabase.ts file. Once this migration is applied to your Supabase database, the errors should be resolved and your progress tracking functionality will work correctly.
