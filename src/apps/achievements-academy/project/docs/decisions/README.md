# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Achievements Academy project. ADRs are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the application.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context, consequences, and implementation details. They help teams:

- Understand why certain decisions were made
- Avoid repeating discussions about the same topics
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of the system architecture

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# [ADR-XXXX] Title

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Implementation Notes

Any notes about the implementation of this decision.

## References

- [Link to relevant documentation or discussions]
```

## Decision Status

- **Proposed**: The decision is under discussion and not yet finalized
- **Accepted**: The decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: The decision has been superseded by a newer decision
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current Decisions

### Accepted

- **[ADR-0001] Subject-Based Lesson Organization** - How lessons are organized by subject and year
- **[ADR-0002] Context-Based State Management** - Using React Context for global state management
- **[ADR-0003] Gradient-First Theme System** - Comprehensive theme system with gradients and subject-specific styling
- **[ADR-0004] Mobile-First Responsive Design** - Responsive design approach prioritizing mobile experience

### Proposed

*No proposed decisions at this time.*

### Deprecated

*No deprecated decisions at this time.*

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR file** using the template: `docs/decisions/XXXX-title.md`
2. **Use the next sequential number** (e.g., 0005, 0006, etc.)
3. **Set status to "Proposed"** initially
4. **Discuss with the team** and update status as needed
5. **Link to related documentation** in the References section

## Guidelines for Good ADRs

- **Be concise** but include enough context to understand the decision
- **Focus on the "why"** not just the "what"
- **Include consequences** both positive and negative
- **Reference related documentation** and discussions
- **Update status** as decisions evolve
- **Keep them current** with the codebase
