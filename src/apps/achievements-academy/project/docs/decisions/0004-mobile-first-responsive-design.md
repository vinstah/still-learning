# [ADR-0004] Mobile-First Responsive Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs to provide an excellent user experience across all devices:
- Mobile phones (320px - 640px)
- Tablets (640px - 1024px)
- Desktop (1024px+)

We need to decide on a responsive design approach that:
- Prioritizes mobile experience
- Maintains the fantasy aesthetic across all screen sizes
- Ensures touch-friendly interactions
- Optimizes content layout for different viewports
- Provides consistent functionality across devices

## Decision

We will implement a mobile-first responsive design approach using Tailwind CSS with the following characteristics:

1. **Mobile-First Philosophy**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
2. **Consistent Breakpoint System**: Use Tailwind's standard breakpoints (sm: 640px+, md: 768px+, lg: 1024px+)
3. **Touch-Friendly Interactions**: Ensure all interactive elements are properly sized for touch
4. **Flexible Typography**: Text scales appropriately across screen sizes
5. **Adaptive Layouts**: Grid and flexbox layouts that adapt to screen size

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Mobile Optimization**: Excellent experience on mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work on all devices, enhanced on larger screens
- **Consistency**: Same functionality across all screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile network conditions
- **Accessibility**: Touch-friendly interactions improve accessibility
- **Future-Proof**: Scales well with new device sizes

### Negative

- **Design Complexity**: More complex than desktop-only design
- **Testing Overhead**: Need to test across multiple device sizes
- **Content Adaptation**: Some content may need different layouts for mobile
- **Performance Considerations**: Mobile devices have different performance characteristics

## Implementation Notes

- All components use mobile-first Tailwind classes
- Touch targets are minimum 44px height for accessibility
- Typography scales from mobile (text-sm) to desktop (text-lg)
- Grid layouts adapt from single column (mobile) to multi-column (desktop)
- Modal components are optimized for mobile scrolling and interaction
- Images and media are responsive and optimized for different screen sizes
- Navigation adapts from hamburger menu (mobile) to horizontal nav (desktop)
